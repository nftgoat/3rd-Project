# 3rd-Project
## What is the project about?
This is my first project that incorporates Javascript. In this project, I created a randomly generated password using Javascript. There was criteria that I had to follow to get things exactly how they are. It was my duty to add each window prompt, making sure that all of the questions were asked correctly. After all the prompts are answered, a randomly generated password is given!

## What I gained from this project
This assignment really helped me strengthen my skills with Javascript. I took things one step at a time to figure out the best way to complete it. I had a few stuggles along the way, but with time and practice I was able to figure things out, which really helped the understand Javascript concepts a lot more!
